# Detailed Item Descriptions for Risk of Rain 2
## Last Updated: ``03/26/2021`` (Anniversary Update)
Note: This is derived from Stormerpro's Item Description Mod, [you can find their guide here!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1785888599)

This is a very simple language edit for Risk of Rain 2 that adds a more descriptive item description when picking up an item. This essentially copies the item descriptions from the logbook entries since those have been detailed and color coded already. A few items such have also been given an updated description to further clarify what an item does.

Note: It is recommended that you backup both `Items.txt` and `Equipment.txt` as it will save you some time when you want to revert these changes

Open the archive that you downloaded and replace both `Items.txt` and `Equipment.txt` with the new ones:
